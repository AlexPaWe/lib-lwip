----------------------------------------
Possible Performance Parameters of LWIP:
----------------------------------------
- TCP_QUEUE_OOSEQ
  TCP_QUEUE_OOSEQ==1: TCP will queue segments that arrive out of order. Define to 0 if your device is low on memory.8
  Only necessary when packet loss is expectet. Prevents resending of all pakets.
  Enabling is recommended
  
- TCP_SND_BUF
  limit of sender buffer space (in bytes).
  same value as TCP_WND --> maximum throughput
  every active connection buffers to this amount of data (Attention: enough RAM or limit concurrent connections)
  
- LWIP_HEAP or LWIP_POOLS (Already implemented in job.yaml)
  Might be a huge waste of memory but pools should be way faster.
  Tradeoff between memory footprint and speed.
